# wip-vs-leadtime
monte carlo simulation of wip vs leadtime.

This small tool demostrates the relation between wip limits and bottlenecks in a project.

On the second tabpage of the tool you can play with the parameters of the simulation.
The tool accepts a Json file as its configuration. 
So it should be fearly easy to store and load your specific configurations.
The configuration allows you to modify the (swim)lanes, add or remove teammembers, change wip limits etc.

If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know.
